    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of implementing algorithms and using data structures in Python. Algorithms are step-by-step instructions to solve specific problems, while data structures allow you to organize and store data efficiently. We will cover the implementation of basic algorithms using sequence, selection, and iteration constructs, as well as the usage of common data structures such as lists and dictionaries. Let's get started!"
